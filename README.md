Repo with examples of Spark utilization for Big Data business problems:
 - Spark programming in Scala and Python
 - Querying with SparkSQL
 - Machine Learning with SparkML

We mostly use Databricks for coding, as well as some cloud environments (AWS, IBM)

Some Scala projects are written inside Jupyter Notebooks for convenience, so you need specific Scala kernel to run it 
(see for example Spylon or Almond for Jupyter Notebooks)
